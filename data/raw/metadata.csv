2512.17677v1,Toward Ethical AI Through Bayesian Uncertainty in Neural Question Answering,"We explore Bayesian reasoning as a means to quantify uncertainty in neural networks for question answering. Starting with a multilayer perceptron on the Iris dataset, we show how posterior inference conveys confidence in predictions. We then extend this to language models, applying Bayesian inference first to a frozen head and finally to LoRA-adapted transformers, evaluated on the CommonsenseQA benchmark. Rather than aiming for state-of-the-art accuracy, we compare Laplace approximations against maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates to highlight uncertainty calibration and selective prediction. This allows models to abstain when confidence is low. An ``I don't know'' response not only improves interpretability but also illustrates how Bayesian methods can contribute to more responsible and ethical deployment of neural question-answering systems.",2025-12-19T15:17:19Z,Riccardo Di Sipio,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17677v1
2512.15791v1,Evaluation of AI Ethics Tools in Language Models: A Developers' Perspective Case Stud,"In Artificial Intelligence (AI), language models have gained significant importance due to the widespread adoption of systems capable of simulating realistic conversations with humans through text generation. Because of their impact on society, developing and deploying these language models must be done responsibly, with attention to their negative impacts and possible harms. In this scenario, the number of AI Ethics Tools (AIETs) publications has recently increased. These AIETs are designed to help developers, companies, governments, and other stakeholders establish trust, transparency, and responsibility with their technologies by bringing accepted values to guide AI's design, development, and use stages. However, many AIETs lack good documentation, examples of use, and proof of their effectiveness in practice. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating AIETs in language models. Our approach involved an extensive literature survey on 213 AIETs, and after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, we selected four AIETs: Model Cards, ALTAI, FactSheets, and Harms Modeling. For evaluation, we applied AIETs to language models developed for the Portuguese language, conducting 35 hours of interviews with their developers. The evaluation considered the developers' perspective on the AIETs' use and quality in helping to identify ethical considerations about their model. The results suggest that the applied AIETs serve as a guide for formulating general ethical considerations about language models. However, we note that they do not address unique aspects of these models, such as idiomatic expressions. Additionally, these AIETs did not help to identify potential negative impacts of models for the Portuguese language.",2025-12-16T02:43:37Z,Jhessica Silva; Diego A. B.

2512.15786v1,Cultural Rights and the Rights to Development in the Age of AI: Implications for Global Human Rights Governance,"Cultural rights and the right to development are essential norms within the wider framework of international human rights law. However, recent technological advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and adjacent digital frontier technologies pose significant challenges to the protection and realization of these rights. This owes to the increasing influence of AI systems on the creation and depiction of cultural content, affect the use and distribution of the intellectual property of individuals and communities, and influence cultural participation and expression worldwide. In addition, the growing influence of AI thus risks exacerbating preexisting economic, social and digital divides and reinforcing inequities for marginalized communities. This dynamic challenges the existing interplay between cultural rights and the right to development, and raises questions about the integration of cultural and developmental considerations into emerging AI governance frameworks. To address these challenges, the paper examines the impact of AI on both categories of rights. Conceptually, it analyzes the epistemic and normative limitations of AI with respect to cultural and developmental assumptions embedded in algorithmic design and deployment, but also individual and structural impacts of AI on both rights. On this basis, the paper identifies gaps and tensions in existing AI governance frameworks with respect to cultural rights and the right to development.
  By situating cultural rights and the right to development within the broader landscape of AI and human rights, this paper contributes to the academic discourse on AI ethics, legal frameworks, and international human rights law. Finally, it outlines avenues for future research and policy development based on existing conversations in global AI governance.",2025-12-15T18:56:36Z,Alexander Kriebitz; Caitlin Corrigan; Aive Pevkur; Alberto Santos Ferro; Amanda Horzyk; Dirk Brand; Dohee Kim; Dodzi Koku Hattoh; Flavia Massucci; Gilles Fayad; Kamil Strzepek; Laud Ammah; Lavina Ramkissoon; Mariette Awad; Natalia Amasiadi; Nathan C.

2512.13768v1,Beyond Procedural Compliance: Human Oversight as a Dimension of Well-being Efficacy in AI Governance,"Major AI ethics guidelines and laws, including the EU AI Act, call for effective human oversight, but do not define it as a distinct and developable capacity. This paper introduces human oversight as a well-being capacity, situated within the emerging Well-being Efficacy framework. The concept integrates AI literacy, ethical discernment, and awareness of human needs, acknowledging that some needs may be conflicting or harmful. Because people inevitably project desires, fears, and interests into AI systems, oversight requires the competence to examine and, when necessary, restrain problematic demands.
  The authors argue that the sustainable and cost-effective development of this capacity depends on its integration into education at every level, from professional training to lifelong learning. The frame of human oversight as a well-being capacity provides a practical path from high-level regulatory goals to the continuous cultivation of human agency and responsibility essential for safe and ethical AI. The paper establishes a theoretical foundation for future research on the pedagogical implementation and empirical validation of well-being effectiveness in multiple contexts.",2025-12-15T16:20:59Z,Yao Xie; Walter Cullen,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13768v1
2512.12837v1,"Algorithmic Criminal Liability in Greenwashing: Comparing India, United States, and European Union","AI-powered greenwashing has emerged as an insidious challenge within corporate sustainability governance, exacerbating the opacity of environmental disclosures and subverting regulatory oversight. This study conducts a comparative legal analysis of criminal liability for AI-mediated greenwashing across India, the US, and the EU, exposing doctrinal lacunae in attributing culpability when deceptive claims originate from algorithmic systems. Existing statutes exhibit anthropocentric biases by predicating liability on demonstrable human intent, rendering them ill-equipped to address algorithmic deception. The research identifies a critical gap in jurisprudential adaptation, as prevailing fraud statutes remain antiquated vis-à-vis AI-generated misrepresentation. Utilising a doctrinal legal methodology, this study systematically dissects judicial precedents and statutory instruments, yielding results regarding the potential expansion of corporate criminal liability. Findings underscore the viability of strict liability models, recalibrated governance frameworks for AI accountability, and algorithmic due diligence mandates under ESG regimes. Comparative insights reveal jurisdictional disparities, with the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) offering a potential transnational model. This study contributes to AI ethics and environmental jurisprudence by advocating for a hybrid liability framework integrating algorithmic risk assessment with legal personhood constructs, ensuring algorithmic opacity does not preclude liability enforcement.",2025-12-14T20:49:41Z,Sahibpreet Singh; Manjit Singh,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12837v1

Adopting a dual-module framework (20-hour AI training + embedded ethics discussions), the course introduced deep learning models, LLMs, AIGC, LoRA, and ComfyUI while maintaining the original curriculum structure, supported by dedicated technical instructors. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of phased guidance, balanced technical-ethical approaches, and institutional support. The model improved students' digital skills and strategic cognition while addressing AI ethics, providing a replicable approach combining technical and critical learning in design education.",2025-12-14T02:38:21Z,Wang Jiaqi; Lan Yi; Chen Xiang,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.13730v1
2512.10058v1,Mind the Gap! Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research,"While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, ""aligned"" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.
  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.",2025-12-10T20:28:13Z,Dani Roytburg; Beck Miller,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10058v1
2512.09570v1,The Gender Code: Gendering the Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence,"This paper examines how international AI governance frameworks address gender issues and gender-based harms. The analysis covers binding regulations, such as the EU AI Act; soft law instruments, like the UNESCO Recommendations on AI Ethics; and global initiatives, such as the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI). These instruments reveal emerging trends, including the integration of gender concerns into broader human rights frameworks, a shift toward explicit gender-related provisions, and a growing emphasis on inclusivity and diversity. Yet, some critical gaps persist, including inconsistent treatment of gender across governance documents, limited engagement with intersectionality, and a lack of robust enforcement mechanisms. However, this paper argues that effective AI governance must be intersectional, enforceable, and inclusive. This is key to moving beyond tokenism toward meaningful equity and preventing reinforcement of existing inequalities. The study contributes to ethical AI debates by highlighting the importance of gender-sensitive governance in building a just technological future.",2025-12-10T12:02:47Z,Jelena Cupac,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.09570v1
2512.04598v1,The Ethics of Generative AI,"This chapter discusses the ethics of generative AI. It provides a technical primer to show how generative AI affords experiencing technology as if it were human, and this affordance provides a fruitful focus for the philosophical ethics of generative AI. It then shows how generative AI can both aggravate and alleviate familiar ethical concerns in AI ethics, including responsibility, privacy, bias and fairness, and forms of alienation and exploitation. Finally, the chapter examines ethical questions that arise specifically from generative AI's mimetic generativity, such as debates about authorship and credit, the emergence of as-if social relationships with machines, and new forms of influence, persuasion, and manipulation.",2025-12-04T09:18:06Z,Michael Klenk,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04598v1
2512.00461v1,Whose Personae? Synthetic Persona Experiments in LLM Research and Pathways to Transparency,"Synthetic personae experiments have become a prominent method in Large Language Model alignment research, yet the representativeness and ecological validity of these personae vary considerably between studies. Through a review of 63 peer-reviewed studies published between 2023 and 2025 in leading NLP and AI venues, we reveal a critical gap: task and population of interest are often underspecified in persona-based experiments, despite personalization being fundamentally dependent on these criteria. Our analysis shows substantial differences in user representation, with most studies focusing on limited sociodemographic attributes and only 35% discussing the representativeness of their LLM personae. Based on our findings, we introduce a persona transparency checklist that emphasizes representative sampling, explicit grounding in empirical data, and enhanced ecological validity. Our work provides both a comprehensive assessment of current practices and practical guidelines to improve the rigor and ecological validity of persona-based evaluations in language model alignment research.",2025-11-29T12:27:34Z,Jan Batzner; Volker Stocker; Bingjun Tang; Anusha Natarajan; Qinhao Chen; Stefan Schmid; Gjergji Kasneci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.00461v1
2511.20689v1,Morality in AI. A plea to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks,"Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate human decision-making and behaviour. Ensuring LLM processing of moral meaning therefore has become a critical challenge. Current approaches rely predominantly on bottom-up methods such as fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback. We propose a fundamentally different approach: embedding moral meaning processing directly into the architectural mechanisms and frameworks of transformer-based models through top-down design principles. We first sketch a framework that conceptualizes attention as a dynamic interface mediating between structure and processing, contrasting with existing linear attention frameworks in psychology. We start from established biological-artificial attention analogies in neural architecture design to improve cognitive processing. We extend this analysis to moral processing, using Iris Murdoch's theory of loving attention (sustained, just observation that enables moral transformation by reseeing others with clarity and compassion) to philosophically discuss functional analogies between human and LLM moral processing. We formulate and evaluate potentially promising technical operationalizations to embed morality in LLM architectures and frameworks. We acknowledge the limitations of our exploration and give three key contributions. (1) We conceptualize attention as a dynamic system mechanism mediating between structure and processing. (2) Drawing on the Murdoch notion of loving attention, we outline technical pathways for embedding morality in LLMs, through modified training objectives, runtime weight adjustments, and architectural refinements to attention. (3) We argue that integrating morality into architectures and frameworks complements external, constraint-based methods. We conclude with a call for collaboration between transformer designers and philosophers engaged in AI ethics.",2025-11-21T09:53:43Z,Gunter Bombaerts; Bram Delisse; Uzay Kaymak,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.20689v1
2511.00379v1,Diverse Human Value Alignment for Large Language Models via Ethical Reasoning,"Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with the diverse and evolving human values across different regions and cultures remains a critical challenge in AI ethics. Current alignment approaches often yield superficial conformity rather than genuine ethical understanding, failing to address the complex, context-dependent nature of human values. In this paper, we propose a novel ethical reasoning paradigm for LLMs inspired by well-established ethical decision-making models, aiming at enhancing diverse human value alignment through deliberative ethical reasoning. Our framework consists of a structured five-step process, including contextual fact gathering, hierarchical social norm identification, option generation, multiple-lens ethical impact analysis, and reflection. This theory-grounded approach guides LLMs through an interpretable reasoning process that enhances their ability to understand regional specificities and perform nuanced ethical analysis, which can be implemented with either prompt engineering or supervised fine-tuning methods. We perform evaluations on the SafeWorld benchmark that specially designed for regional value alignment. Experimental results demonstrate our framework significantly improves LLM alignment with diverse human values compared to baseline methods, enabling more accurate social norm identification and more culturally appropriate reasoning. Our work provides a concrete pathway toward developing LLMs that align more effectively with the multifaceted values of global societies through interdisciplinary research.",2025-11-01T03:26:24Z,Jiahao Wang; Songkai Xue; Jinghui Li; Xiaozhen Wang,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00379v1
2510.21293v2,Understanding AI Trustworthiness: A Scoping Review of AIES & FAccT Articles,"Background: Trustworthy AI serves as a foundational pillar for two major AI ethics conferences: AIES and FAccT. However, current research often adopts techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts.
  Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness, identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding of trustworthy AI systems.
  Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values.
  Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it.
  Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological development that benefits all stakeholders.",2025-10-24T09:40:38Z,Siddharth Mehrotra; Jin Huang; Xuelong Fu; Roel Dobbe; Clara I.

2510.14676v1,NAEL: Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic,"We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics, NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.",2025-10-16T13:33:10Z,Bianca Maria Lerma; Rafael Peñaloza,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14676v1
2510.14669v1,Machine Learning and Public Health: Identifying and Mitigating Algorithmic Bias through a Systematic Review,"Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However, without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity rather than undermine it.",2025-10-16T13:24:11Z,Sara Altamirano; Arjan Vreeken; Sennay Ghebreab,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14669v1
2510.12844v1,AI Alignment vs. AI Ethical Treatment: 10 Challenges,"A morally acceptable course of AI development should avoid two dangers: creating unaligned AI systems that pose a threat to humanity and mistreating AI systems that merit moral consideration in their own right. This paper argues these two dangers interact and that if we create AI systems that merit moral consideration, simultaneously avoiding both of these dangers would be extremely challenging. While our argument is straightforward and supported by a wide range of pretheoretical moral judgments, it has far-reaching moral implications for AI development. Although the most obvious way to avoid the tension between alignment and ethical treatment would be to avoid creating AI systems that merit moral consideration, this option may be unrealistic and is perhaps fleeting. So, we conclude by offering some suggestions for other ways of mitigating mistreatment risks associated with alignment.",2025-10-14T00:13:23Z,Adam Bradley; Bradford Saad,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12844v1
2510.10588v1,"Making Power Explicable in AI: Analyzing, Understanding, and Redirecting Power to Operationalize Ethics in AI Technical Practice","The operationalization of ethics in the technical practices of artificial intelligence (AI) is facing significant challenges. To address the problem of ineffective implementation of AI ethics, we present our diagnosis, analysis, and interventional recommendations from a unique perspective of the real-world implementation of AI ethics through explainable AI (XAI) techniques. We first describe the phenomenon (i.e., the ""symptoms"") of ineffective implementation of AI ethics in explainable AI using four empirical cases. From the ""symptoms"", we diagnose the root cause (i.e., the ""disease"") being the dysfunction and imbalance of power structures in the sociotechnical system of AI. The power structures are dominated by unjust and unchecked power that does not represent the benefits and interests of the public and the most impacted communities, and cannot be countervailed by ethical power. Based on the understanding of power mechanisms, we propose three interventional recommendations to tackle the root cause, including: 1) Making power explicable and checked, 2) Reframing the narratives and assumptions of AI and AI ethics to check unjust power and reflect the values and benefits of the public, and 3) Uniting the efforts of ethical and scientific conduct of AI to encode ethical values as technical standards, norms, and methods, including conducting critical examinations and limitation analyses of AI technical practices. We hope that our diagnosis and interventional recommendations can be a useful input to the AI community and civil society's ongoing discussion and implementation of ethics in AI for ethical and responsible AI practice.",2025-10-12T13:09:22Z,Weina Jin; Elise Li Zheng; Ghassan Hamarneh,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10588v1
2510.10339v1,"Measuring What Matters: Connecting AI Ethics Evaluations to System Attributes, Hazards, and Harms","Over the past decade, an ecosystem of measures has emerged to evaluate the social and ethical implications of AI systems, largely shaped by high-level ethics principles. These measures are developed and used in fragmented ways, without adequate attention to how they are situated in AI systems. In this paper, we examine how existing measures used in the computing literature map to AI system components, attributes, hazards, and harms. Our analysis draws on a scoping review resulting in nearly 800 measures corresponding to 11 AI ethics principles. We find that most measures focus on four principles - fairness, transparency, privacy, and trust - and primarily assess model or output system components. Few measures account for interactions across system elements, and only a narrow set of hazards is typically considered for each harm type. Many measures are disconnected from where harm is experienced and lack guidance for setting meaningful thresholds. These patterns reveal how current evaluation practices remain fragmented, measuring in pieces rather than capturing how harms emerge across systems. Framing measures with respect to system attributes, hazards, and harms can strengthen regulatory oversight, support actionable practices in industry, and ground future research in systems-level understanding.",2025-10-11T20:52:21Z,Shalaleh Rismani; Renee Shelby; Leah Davis; Negar Rostamzadeh; AJung Moon,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10339v1
2510.09439v2,Towards Ethical AI in Power Electronics: How Engineering Practice and Roles Must Adapt,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context, this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics: Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm design, system deployment, and the preparation of an AI-ready engineering workforce. The authors advocate for power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies. The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to spearhead the establishment of ethical standards, talent development initiatives, and best practices that ensure AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also oriented toward human and societal benefit.",2025-10-10T14:51:02Z,Fanfan Lin; Peter Wilson; Xinze Li; Alan Mantooth,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09439v2
2510.07491v1,Optimizing Ethical Risk Reduction for Medical Intelligent Systems with Constraint Programming,"Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.",2025-10-08T19:40:11Z,Clotilde Brayé; Aurélien Bricout; Arnaud Gotlieb; Nadjib Lazaar; Quentin Vallet,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07491v1
2510.05519v1,Assessing Human Rights Risks in AI: A Framework for Model Evaluation,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international agreements outline numerous inalienable rights that apply across geopolitical boundaries. As generative AI becomes increasingly prevalent, it poses risks to human rights such as non-discrimination, health, and security, which are also central concerns for AI researchers focused on fairness and safety. We contribute to the field of algorithmic auditing by presenting a framework to computationally assess human rights risk. Drawing on the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, we develop an approach to evaluating a model to make grounded claims about the level of risk a model poses to particular human rights. Our framework consists of three parts: selecting tasks that are likely to pose human rights risks within a given context, designing metrics to measure the scope, scale, and likelihood of potential risks from that task, and analyzing rights with respect to the values of those metrics. Because a human rights approach centers on real-world harms, it requires evaluating AI systems in the specific contexts in which they are deployed. We present a case study of large language models in political news journalism, demonstrating how our framework helps to design an evaluation and benchmarking different models. We then discuss the implications of the results for the rights of access to information and freedom of thought and broader considerations for adopting this approach.",2025-10-07T02:12:56Z,Vyoma Raman; Camille Chabot; Betsy Popken,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05519v1
2510.05292v1,Disclosure and Evaluation as Fairness Interventions for General-Purpose AI,"Despite conflicting definitions and conceptions of fairness, AI fairness researchers broadly agree that fairness is context-specific. However, when faced with general-purpose AI, which by definition serves a range of contexts, how should we think about fairness? We argue that while we cannot be prescriptive about what constitutes fair outcomes, we can specify the processes that different stakeholders should follow in service of fairness. Specifically, we consider the obligations of two major groups: system providers and system deployers. While system providers are natural candidates for regulatory attention, the current state of AI understanding offers limited insight into how upstream factors translate into downstream fairness impacts. Thus, we recommend that providers invest in evaluative research studying how model development decisions influence fairness and disclose whom they are serving their models to, or at the very least, reveal sufficient information for external researchers to conduct such research. On the other hand, system deployers are closer to real-world contexts and can leverage their proximity to end users to address fairness harms in different ways. Here, we argue they should responsibly disclose information about users and personalization and conduct rigorous evaluations across different levels of fairness. Overall, instead of focusing on enforcing fairness outcomes, we prioritize intentional information-gathering by system providers and deployers that can facilitate later context-aware action. This allows us to be specific and concrete about the processes even while the contexts remain unknown. Ultimately, this approach can sharpen how we distribute fairness responsibilities and inform more fluid, context-sensitive interventions as AI continues to advance.",2025-10-06T19:00:42Z,Vyoma Raman; Judy Hanwen Shen; Andy K.

2510.04609v1,Accountability Capture: How Record-Keeping to Support AI Transparency and Accountability (Re)shapes Algorithmic Oversight,"Accountability regimes typically encourage record-keeping to enable the transparency that supports oversight, investigation, contestation, and redress. However, implementing such record-keeping can introduce considerations, risks, and consequences, which so far remain under-explored. This paper examines how record-keeping practices bring algorithmic systems within accountability regimes, providing a basis to observe and understand their effects. For this, we introduce, describe, and elaborate 'accountability capture' -- the re-configuration of socio-technical processes and the associated downstream effects relating to record-keeping for algorithmic accountability. Surveying 100 practitioners, we evidence and characterise record-keeping issues in practice, identifying their alignment with accountability capture. We further document widespread record-keeping practices, tensions between internal and external accountability requirements, and evidence of employee resistance to practices imposed through accountability capture. We discuss these and other effects for surveillance, privacy, and data protection, highlighting considerations for algorithmic accountability communities. In all, we show that implementing record-keeping to support transparency in algorithmic accountability regimes can itself bring wider implications -- an issue requiring greater attention from practitioners, researchers, and policymakers alike.",2025-10-06T09:20:27Z,Shreya Chappidi; Jennifer Cobbe; Chris Norval; Anjali Mazumder; Jatinder Singh,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04609v1

However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic status.

While ethics has received growing attention in computer science (CS) education more broadly, the specific pedagogical treatment of {AI ethics} remains under-examined. This study addresses that gap through a large-scale analysis of 3,395 publicly accessible syllabi from CS and allied areas at leading Indian institutions. Among them, only 75 syllabi (2.21%) included any substantive AI ethics content. Three key findings emerged: (1) AI ethics is typically integrated as a minor module within broader technical courses rather than as a standalone course; (2) ethics coverage is often limited to just one or two instructional sessions; and (3) recurring topics include algorithmic fairness, privacy and data governance, transparency, and societal impact. While these themes reflect growing awareness, current curricular practices reveal limited depth and consistency. This work highlights both the progress and the gaps in preparing future technologists to engage meaningfully with the ethical dimensions of AI, and it offers suggestions to strengthen the integration of AI ethics within computing curricula.",2025-09-26T13:24:01Z,Anshu M Mittal; P D Parthasarathy; Swaroop Joshi,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22329v1
2509.18079v1,Tracing the Techno-Supremacy Doctrine: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the AI Executive Elite,"This paper critically analyzes the discourse of the 'AI executive elite,' a group of highly influential individuals shaping the way AI is funded, developed, and deployed worldwide. The primary objective is to examine the presence and dynamics of the 'Techno-Supremacy Doctrine' (TSD), a term introduced in this study to describe a belief system characterized by an excessive trust in technology's alleged inherent superiority in solving complex societal problems. This study integrates quantitative heuristics with in-depth qualitative investigations. Its methodology is operationalized in a two-phase critical discourse analysis of 14 texts published by elite members between 2017 and 2025. The findings demonstrate that the elite is not a monolithic bloc but exhibits a broad spectrum of stances. The discourse is highly dynamic, showing a marked polarization and general increase in pro-TSD discourse following the launch of ChatGPT. The analysis identifies key discursive patterns, including a dominant pro-TSD narrative that combines utopian promises with claims of inevitable progress, and the common tactic of acknowledging risks only as a strategic preamble to proposing further technological solutions. This paper presents TSD as a comprehensive analytical framework and provides a 'diagnostic toolkit' for identifying its manifestations, from insidious to benign. It argues that fostering critical awareness of these discursive patterns is essential for AI practitioners, policymakers, and the public to actively navigate the future of AI.",2025-09-22T17:55:38Z,Héctor Pérez-Urbina,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18079v1
2509.17727v1,"Empirical AI Ethics: Reconfiguring Ethics towards a Situated, Plural, and Transformative Approach","Mainstream AI ethics, with its reliance on top-down, principle-driven frameworks, fails to account for the situated realities of diverse communities affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Critics have argued that AI ethics frequently serves corporate interests through practices of 'ethics washing', operating more as a tool for public relations than as a means of preventing harm or advancing the common good. As a result, growing scepticism among critical scholars has cast the field as complicit in sustaining harmful systems rather than challenging or transforming them. In response, this paper adopts a Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective to critically interrogate the field of AI ethics. It hence applies the same analytic tools STS has long directed at disciplines such as biology, medicine, and statistics to ethics. This perspective reveals a core tension between vertical (top-down, principle-based) and horizontal (risk-mitigating, implementation-oriented) approaches to ethics. By tracing how these models have shaped the discourse, we show how both fall short in addressing the complexities of AI as a socio-technical assemblage, embedded in practice and entangled with power. To move beyond these limitations, we propose a threefold reorientation of AI ethics. First, we call for a shift in foundations: from top-down abstraction to empirical grounding. Second, we advocate for pluralisation: moving beyond Western-centric frameworks toward a multiplicity of onto-epistemic perspectives. Finally, we outline strategies for reconfiguring AI ethics as a transformative force, moving from narrow paradigms of risk mitigation toward co-creating technologies of hope.",2025-09-22T12:58:15Z,Paula Helm; Selin Gerlek,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.17727v1

This study explores how AI-powered tools can offer innovative privacy protections through clear, personalized, and contextual support to users. Through 23 in-depth interviews with users, AI developers, designers, and regulators, and using Grounded Theory analysis, we identified two key themes: Aspirations for AI-Enhanced Privacy - how users perceive AI's potential to empower them, address power imbalances, and improve ease of use- and AI Ethical, Security, and Regulatory Considerations-challenges in strengthening data security, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting ethical AI practices. Our findings contribute to the field by uncovering user aspirations for AI-driven privacy solutions, identifying key security and ethical challenges, and providing actionable recommendations for all stakeholders, particularly targeting smart device designers and AI developers, to guide the co-design of AI tools that enhance privacy protection in smart home devices. By bridging the gap between user expectations, AI capabilities, and regulatory frameworks, this work offers practical insights for shaping the future of privacy-conscious AI integration in smart homes.",2025-09-17T14:53:58Z,Wael Albayaydh; Ivan Flechais; Rui Zhao; Jood Albayaydh,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14050v1

Systems such as Microsoft copilot, Gemini and the expected Apple intelligence still awaits our prompt for action. Yet, it is likely that AI assistant systems will only become better at predicting our behaviour and acting on our behalf. Imagine new generations of generative and predictive AI deciding what you might like best at a new restaurant, picking an outfit that increases your chances on your date with a partner also chosen by the same or a similar system. Far from a science fiction scenario, the goal of several research programs is to build systems capable of assisting us in exactly this manner. The prospect urges us to rethink human-technology relations, but it also invites us to question how such systems might change the way we relate to ourselves. Building on our conception of the relational self, we question the possible effects of generative AI with respect to what we call the sphere of externalised output, the contextual sphere and the sphere of self-relating. In this paper, we attempt to deepen the existential considerations accompanying the AI revolution by outlining how generative AI enables the fulfilment of tasks and also increasingly anticipates, i.e. intercepts, our initiatives in these different spheres.",2025-09-16T14:07:39Z,Sandrine R.

Yet, existing benchmarks for moral and clinical decision-making do not adequately capture the unique ethical dilemmas encountered in mental health practice, where confidentiality, autonomy, beneficence, and bias frequently intersect. To address this gap, we introduce Ethical Reasoning in Mental Health (EthicsMH), a pilot dataset of 125 scenarios designed to evaluate how AI systems navigate ethically charged situations in therapeutic and psychiatric contexts. Each scenario is enriched with structured fields, including multiple decision options, expert-aligned reasoning, expected model behavior, real-world impact, and multi-stakeholder viewpoints. This structure enables evaluation not only of decision accuracy but also of explanation quality and alignment with professional norms. Although modest in scale and developed with model-assisted generation, EthicsMH establishes a task framework that bridges AI ethics and mental health decision-making. By releasing this dataset, we aim to provide a seed resource that can be expanded through community and expert contributions, fostering the development of AI systems capable of responsibly handling some of society's most delicate decisions.",2025-09-15T07:35:35Z,Sai Kartheek Reddy Kasu,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11648v1

This paper synthesizes literature and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives, generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance.

2509.04404v2,No Thoughts Just AI: Biased LLM Hiring Recommendations Alter Human Decision Making and Limit Human Autonomy,"In this study, we conduct a resume-screening experiment (N=528) where people collaborate with simulated AI models exhibiting race-based preferences (bias) to evaluate candidates for 16 high and low status occupations. Simulated AI bias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in real-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups on quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their unconscious associations between race and status using implicit association tests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been investigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or with AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates at equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group, people also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a significant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose identities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13% if people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if people think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their decisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This work has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work, design and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias in collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and regulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision making when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and determining which are subject to oversight.",2025-09-04T17:16:26Z,Kyra Wilson; Mattea Sim; Anna-Maria Gueorguieva; Aylin Caliskan,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04404v2
2509.02624v1,Who Owns The Robot?: Four Ethical and Socio-technical Questions about Wellbeing Robots in the Real World through Community Engagement,"Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference, and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science. In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants' insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why a robot?.",2025-09-01T13:38:50Z,Minja Axelsson; Jiaee Cheong; Rune Nyrup; Hatice Gunes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02624v1
2509.01060v2,When the Past Misleads: Rethinking Training Data Expansion Under Temporal Distribution Shifts,"Predictive models are typically trained on historical data to predict future outcomes. While it is commonly assumed that training on more historical data would improve model performance and robustness, data distribution shifts over time may undermine these benefits. This study examines how expanding historical data training windows under covariate shifts (changes in feature distributions) and concept shifts (changes in feature-outcome relationships) affects the performance and algorithmic fairness of predictive models. First, we perform a simulation study to explore scenarios with varying degrees of covariate and concept shifts in training data. Absent distribution shifts, we observe performance gains from longer training windows though they reach a plateau quickly; in the presence of concept shift, performance may actually decline. Covariate shifts alone do not significantly affect model performance, but may complicate the impact of concept shifts. In terms of fairness, models produce more biased predictions when the magnitude of concept shifts differs across sociodemographic groups; for intersectional groups, these effects are more complex and not simply additive. Second, we conduct an empirical case study of student retention prediction, a common machine learning application in education, using 12 years of student records from 23 minority-serving community colleges in the United States. We find concept shifts to be a key contributor to performance degradation when expanding the training window. Moreover, model fairness is compromised when marginalized populations have distinct data distribution shift patterns from their peers. Overall, our findings caution against conventional wisdom that ""more data is better"" and underscore the importance of using historical data judiciously, especially when it may be subject to data distribution shifts, to improve model performance and fairness.",2025-09-01T02:05:39Z,Chengyuan Yao; Yunxuan Tang; Christopher Brooks; Rene F.

2509.00398v4,A Study on the Framework for Evaluating the Ethics and Trustworthiness of Generative AI,"This study provides an in_depth analysis of the ethical and trustworthiness challenges emerging alongside the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and proposes a comprehensive framework for their systematic evaluation. While generative AI, such as ChatGPT, demonstrates remarkable innovative potential, it simultaneously raises ethical and social concerns, including bias, harmfulness, copyright infringement, privacy violations, and hallucination. Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts. Ultimately, the study establishes an academic foundation for the responsible advancement of generative AI and delivers actionable insights for policymakers, developers, users, and other stakeholders, supporting the positive societal contributions of AI technologies.",2025-08-30T07:38:07Z,Cheonsu Jeong; Seunghyun Lee; Seonhee Jeong; Sungsu Kim,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00398v4

Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories, while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems that deepen our understanding of the human mind.

However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work, researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses, we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices for Participatory AI researchers.",2025-08-27T18:00:46Z,Eugene Kim; Vaibhav Balloli; Berelian Karimian; Elizabeth Bondi-Kelly; Benjamin Fish,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20176v1
2508.19883v1,AI-Powered Detection of Inappropriate Language in Medical School Curricula,"The use of inappropriate language -- such as outdated, exclusionary, or non-patient-centered terms -- medical instructional materials can significantly influence clinical training, patient interactions, and health outcomes. Despite their reputability, many materials developed over past decades contain examples now considered inappropriate by current medical standards. Given the volume of curricular content, manually identifying instances of inappropriate use of language (IUL) and its subcategories for systematic review is prohibitively costly and impractical. To address this challenge, we conduct a first-in-class evaluation of small language models (SLMs) fine-tuned on labeled data and pre-trained LLMs with in-context learning on a dataset containing approximately 500 documents and over 12,000 pages. For SLMs, we consider: (1) a general IUL classifier, (2) subcategory-specific binary classifiers, (3) a multilabel classifier, and (4) a two-stage hierarchical pipeline for general IUL detection followed by multilabel classification. For LLMs, we consider variations of prompts that include subcategory definitions and/or shots. We found that both LLama-3 8B and 70B, even with carefully curated shots, are largely outperformed by SLMs. While the multilabel classifier performs best on annotated data, supplementing training with unflagged excerpts as negative examples boosts the specific classifiers' AUC by up to 25%, making them most effective models for mitigating harmful language in medical curricula.",2025-08-27T13:40:45Z,Chiman Salavati; Shannon Song; Scott A.

2508.17465v1,Bias Amplification in Stable Diffusion's Representation of Stigma Through Skin Tones and Their Homogeneity,"Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities.",2025-08-24T17:47:52Z,Kyra Wilson; Sourojit Ghosh; Aylin Caliskan,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17465v1
2508.14231v1,Incident Analysis for AI Agents,"As AI agents become more widely deployed, we are likely to see an increasing number of incidents: events involving AI agent use that directly or indirectly cause harm. For example, agents could be prompt-injected to exfiltrate private information or make unauthorized purchases. Structured information about such incidents (e.g., user prompts) can help us understand their causes and prevent future occurrences. However, existing incident reporting processes are not sufficient for understanding agent incidents. In particular, such processes are largely based on publicly available data, which excludes useful, but potentially sensitive, information such as an agent's chain of thought or browser history. To inform the development of new, emerging incident reporting processes, we propose an incident analysis framework for agents. Drawing on systems safety approaches, our framework proposes three types of factors that can cause incidents: system-related (e.g., CBRN training data), contextual (e.g., prompt injections), and cognitive (e.g., misunderstanding a user request). We also identify specific information that could help clarify which factors are relevant to a given incident: activity logs, system documentation and access, and information about the tools an agent uses. We provide recommendations for 1) what information incident reports should include and 2) what information developers and deployers should retain and make available to incident investigators upon request. As we transition to a world with more agents, understanding agent incidents will become increasingly crucial for managing risks.",2025-08-19T19:39:37Z,Carson Ezell; Xavier Roberts-Gaal; Alan Chan,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14231v1

Through an analysis of representative manifesto-style texts, we explore how these imaginaries differ across four dimensions: normative visions of the future, diagnoses of the present social order, views on science and technology, and perceived human agency in managing AI risks. Our findings reveal how these narratives embed distinct assumptions about risk and have the potential to progress into policy-making processes by narrowing the space for alternative governance approaches.

2508.10482v2,When Explainability Meets Privacy: An Investigation at the Intersection of Post-hoc Explainability and Differential Privacy in the Context of Natural Language Processing,"In the study of trustworthy Natural Language Processing (NLP), a number of important research fields have emerged, including that of explainability and privacy. While research interest in both explainable and privacy-preserving NLP has increased considerably in recent years, there remains a lack of investigation at the intersection of the two. This leaves a considerable gap in understanding of whether achieving both explainability and privacy is possible, or whether the two are at odds with each other. In this work, we conduct an empirical investigation into the privacy-explainability trade-off in the context of NLP, guided by the popular overarching methods of Differential Privacy (DP) and Post-hoc Explainability. Our findings include a view into the intricate relationship between privacy and explainability, which is formed by a number of factors, including the nature of the downstream task and choice of the text privatization and explainability method. In this, we highlight the potential for privacy and explainability to co-exist, and we summarize our findings in a collection of practical recommendations for future work at this important intersection.",2025-08-14T09:34:29Z,Mahdi Dhaini; Stephen Meisenbacher; Ege Erdogan; Florian Matthes; Gjergji Kasneci,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.10482v2

The growing opacity of complex models calls for transparency and explanations of their decisions, which is crucial to understand their reasoning and facilitate deployment, especially in high-stakes environments. Despite increasing attention given to explainable NLP, practitioners' perspectives regarding its practical adoption and effectiveness remain underexplored. This paper addresses this research gap by investigating practitioners' experiences with explainability methods, specifically focusing on their motivations for adopting such methods, the techniques employed, satisfaction levels, and the practical challenges encountered in real-world NLP applications. Through a qualitative interview-based study with industry practitioners and complementary interviews with academic researchers, we systematically analyze and compare their perspectives. Our findings reveal conceptual gaps, low satisfaction with current explainability methods, and highlight evaluation challenges.

We introduce PETLP (Privacy-by-design Extract, Transform, Load, and Present), a compliance framework that embeds legal safeguards directly into extended ETL pipelines. Central to PETLP is treating Data Protection Impact Assessments as living documents that evolve from pre-registration through dissemination. Through systematic Reddit analysis, we demonstrate how extraction rights fundamentally differ between qualifying research organisations (who can invoke DSM Article 3 to override platform restrictions) and commercial entities (bound by terms of service), whilst GDPR obligations apply universally. We demonstrate why true anonymisation remains unachievable for social media data and expose the legal gap between permitted dataset creation and uncertain model distribution. By structuring compliance decisions into practical workflows and simplifying institutional data management plans, PETLP enables researchers to navigate regulatory complexity with confidence, bridging the gap between legal requirements and research practice.",2025-08-12T08:33:40Z,Nick Oh; Giorgos D.

Drawing on prior research and principles from design thinking, we propose a three-part framework for explanation design in XAI: asking Who needs the explanation, What they need explained, and How that explanation should be delivered. We also emphasize the need for ethical considerations, including risks of epistemic inequality, reinforcing social inequities, and obscuring accountability and governance. By treating explanation as a sociotechnical design process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that supports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible explanations.",2025-08-12T08:17:26Z,Ruchira Dhar; Stephanie Brandl; Ninell Oldenburg; Anders Søgaard,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09231v1
2508.08573v2,Who Pays the RENT? Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies,"AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies.",2025-08-12T02:16:50Z,Tasfia Mashiat; Patrick J.

2508.08544v1,AI Agents and the Law,"As AI becomes more ""agentic,"" it faces technical and socio-legal issues it must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However, to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI, wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification. Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent development and deployment.",2025-08-12T01:18:48Z,Mark O. Riedl; Deven R. Desai,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08544v1
2508.08509v1,Steerable Pluralism: Pluralistic Alignment via Few-Shot Comparative Regression,"Large language models (LLMs) are currently aligned using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). However, these methods use scalar rewards that can only reflect user preferences on average. Pluralistic alignment instead seeks to capture diverse user preferences across a set of attributes, moving beyond just helpfulness and harmlessness. Toward this end, we propose a steerable pluralistic model based on few-shot comparative regression that can adapt to individual user preferences. Our approach leverages in-context learning and reasoning, grounded in a set of fine-grained attributes, to compare response options and make aligned choices. To evaluate our algorithm, we also propose two new steerable pluralistic benchmarks by adapting the Moral Integrity Corpus (MIC) and the HelpSteer2 datasets, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to value-aligned decision-making and reward modeling, respectively. Our few-shot comparative regression approach is interpretable and compatible with different attributes and LLMs, while outperforming multiple baseline and state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides new insights and research directions in pluralistic alignment, enabling a more fair and representative use of LLMs and advancing the state-of-the-art in ethical AI.",2025-08-11T22:40:31Z,Jadie Adams; Brian Hu; Emily Veenhuis; David Joy; Bharadwaj Ravichandran; Aaron Bray; Anthony Hoogs; Arslan Basharat,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08509v1
2508.09219v2,Ethics Practices in AI Development: An Empirical Study Across Roles and Regions,"Recent advances in AI applications have raised growing concerns about the need for ethical guidelines and regulations to mitigate the risks posed by these technologies. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods survey study - combining statistical and qualitative analyses - to examine the ethical perceptions, practices, and knowledge of individuals involved in various AI development roles. Our survey comprises 414 participants from 43 countries, representing various roles such as AI managers, analysts, developers, quality assurance professionals, and information security and privacy experts. The results reveal varying degrees of familiarity and experience with AI ethics principles, government initiatives, and risk mitigation strategies across roles, regions, and other demographic factors. Our findings underscore the importance of a collaborative, role-sensitive approach that involves diverse stakeholders in ethical decision-making throughout the AI development lifecycle. We advocate for developing tailored, inclusive solutions to address ethical challenges in AI development, and we propose future research directions and educational strategies to promote ethics-aware AI practices.",2025-08-11T19:07:20Z,Wilder Baldwin; Sepideh Ghanavati; Manuel Woersdoerfer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09219v2
2508.08231v3,A Moral Agency Framework for Legitimate Integration of AI in Bureaucracies,"Public-sector bureaucracies seek to reap the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI), but face important concerns about accountability and transparency when using AI systems. In particular, perception or actuality of AI agency might create ethics sinks - constructs that facilitate dissipation of responsibility when AI systems of disputed moral status interface with bureaucratic structures. Here, we reject the notion that ethics sinks are a necessary consequence of introducing AI systems into bureaucracies. Rather, where they appear, they are the product of structural design decisions across both the technology and the institution deploying it. We support this claim via a systematic application of conceptions of moral agency in AI ethics to Weberian bureaucracy. We establish that it is both desirable and feasible to render AI systems as tools for the generation of organizational transparency and legibility, which continue the processes of Weberian rationalization initiated by previous waves of digitalization. We present a three-point Moral Agency Framework for legitimate integration of AI in bureaucratic structures: (a) maintain clear and just human lines of accountability, (b) ensure humans whose work is augmented by AI systems can verify the systems are functioning correctly, and (c) introduce AI only where it doesn't inhibit the capacity of bureaucracies towards either of their twin aims of legitimacy and stewardship. We suggest that AI introduced within this framework can not only improve efficiency and productivity while avoiding ethics sinks, but also improve the transparency and even the legitimacy of a bureaucracy.",2025-08-11T17:49:19Z,Chris Schmitz; Joanna Bryson,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08231v3
2508.08193v2,Street-Level AI: Are Large Language Models Ready for Real-World Judgments?,"A surge of recent work explores the ethical and societal implications of large-scale AI models that make ""moral"" judgments. Much of this literature focuses either on alignment with human judgments through various thought experiments or on the group fairness implications of AI judgments. However, the most immediate and likely use of AI is to help or fully replace the so-called street-level bureaucrats, the individuals deciding to allocate scarce social resources or approve benefits. There is a rich history underlying how principles of local justice determine how society decides on prioritization mechanisms in such domains. In this paper, we examine how well LLM judgments align with human judgments, as well as with socially and politically determined vulnerability scoring systems currently used in the domain of homelessness resource allocation. Crucially, we use real data on those needing services (maintaining strict confidentiality by only using local large models) to perform our analyses. We find that LLM prioritizations are extremely inconsistent in several ways: internally on different runs, between different LLMs, and between LLMs and the vulnerability scoring systems. At the same time, LLMs demonstrate qualitative consistency with lay human judgments in pairwise testing. Findings call into question the readiness of current generation AI systems for naive integration in high-stakes societal decision-making.",2025-08-11T17:12:55Z,Gaurab Pokharel; Shafkat Farabi; Patrick J.

2508.07095v1,Hide or Highlight: Understanding the Impact of Factuality Expression on User Trust,"Large language models are known to produce outputs that are plausible but factually incorrect. To prevent people from making erroneous decisions by blindly trusting AI, researchers have explored various ways of communicating factuality estimates in AI-generated outputs to end-users. However, little is known about whether revealing content estimated to be factually incorrect influences users' trust when compared to hiding it altogether. We tested four different ways of disclosing an AI-generated output with factuality assessments: transparent (highlights less factual content), attention (highlights factual content), opaque (removes less factual content), ambiguity (makes less factual content vague), and compared them with a baseline response without factuality information. We conducted a human subjects research (N = 148) using the strategies in question-answering scenarios. We found that the opaque and ambiguity strategies led to higher trust while maintaining perceived answer quality, compared to the other strategies. We discuss the efficacy of hiding presumably less factual content to build end-user trust.",2025-08-09T20:45:21Z,Hyo Jin Do; Werner Geyer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07095v1

While several technical advancements have been made to detect hallucinated content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses, there is still limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users. To address this gap, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with a total of 208 participants to systematically compare the effects of various design strategies for communicating factuality scores by assessing participants' ratings of trust, ease in validating response accuracy, and preference. Our findings reveal that participants preferred and trusted a design in which all phrases within a response were color-coded based on factuality scores. Participants also found it easier to validate accuracy of the response in this style compared to a baseline with no style applied. Our study offers practical design guidelines for LLM application developers and designers, aimed at calibrating user trust, aligning with user preferences, and enhancing users' ability to scrutinize LLM outputs.",2025-08-09T06:00:15Z,Hyo Jin Do; Rachel Ostrand; Werner Geyer; Keerthiram Murugesan; Dennis Wei; Justin Weisz,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06846v1

Evaluating LLM Reliability and Abstention for Religious Questions,"Despite the increasing usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) in answering questions in a variety of domains, their reliability and accuracy remain unexamined for a plethora of domains including the religious domains. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark FiqhQA focused on the LLM generated Islamic rulings explicitly categorized by the four major Sunni schools of thought, in both Arabic and English. Unlike prior work, which either overlooks the distinctions between religious school of thought or fails to evaluate abstention behavior, we assess LLMs not only on their accuracy but also on their ability to recognize when not to answer. Our zero-shot and abstention experiments reveal significant variation across LLMs, languages, and legal schools of thought. While GPT-4o outperforms all other models in accuracy, Gemini and Fanar demonstrate superior abstention behavior critical for minimizing confident incorrect answers. Notably, all models exhibit a performance drop in Arabic, highlighting the limitations in religious reasoning for languages other than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to benchmark the efficacy of LLMs for fine-grained Islamic school of thought specific ruling generation and to evaluate abstention for Islamic jurisprudence queries. Our findings underscore the need for task-specific evaluation and cautious deployment of LLMs in religious applications.",2025-08-04T07:27:26Z,Farah Atif; Nursultan Askarbekuly; Kareem Darwish; Monojit Choudhury,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08287v1

Rooted in the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of ""Cyber Humanities"" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.
  Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, ""Cyber Humanities"" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic inquiry in a computationally mediated world.

A range of approaches has been proposed to address or reduce these risks, including the development of ethical guidelines and principles for responsible AI, as well as technical solutions that promote algorithmic fairness. Drawing on design justice, expansive learning theory, and recent empirical work on participatory AI, we argue that mitigating these harms requires a fundamental re-architecture of the AI production pipeline. This re-design should center co-production, diversity, equity, inclusion (DEI), and multidisciplinary collaboration. We introduce an augmented AI lifecycle consisting of five interconnected phases: co-framing, co-design, co-implementation, co-deployment, and co-maintenance. The lifecycle is informed by four multidisciplinary workshops and grounded in themes of distributed authority and iterative knowledge exchange. Finally, we relate the proposed lifecycle to several leading ethical frameworks and outline key research questions that remain for scaling participatory governance.",2025-07-31T19:58:58Z,Rashid Mushkani; Hugo Berard; Toumadher Ammar; Cassandre Chatonnier; Shin Koseki,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00138v1
2507.23718v1,Informing AI Risk Assessment with News Media: Analyzing National and Political Variation in the Coverage of AI Risks,"Risk-based approaches to AI governance often center the technological artifact as the primary focus of risk assessments, overlooking systemic risks that emerge from the complex interaction between AI systems and society. One potential source to incorporate more societal context into these approaches is the news media, as it embeds and reflects complex interactions between AI systems, human stakeholders, and the larger society. News media is influential in terms of which AI risks are emphasized and discussed in the public sphere, and thus which risks are deemed important. Yet, variations in the news media between countries and across different value systems (e.g. political orientations) may differentially shape the prioritization of risks through the media's agenda setting and framing processes. To better understand these variations, this work presents a comparative analysis of a cross-national sample of news media spanning 6 countries (the U.S., the U.K., India, Australia, Israel, and South Africa). Our findings show that AI risks are prioritized differently across nations and shed light on how left vs. right leaning U.S. based outlets not only differ in the prioritization of AI risks in their coverage, but also use politicized language in the reporting of these risks. These findings can inform risk assessors and policy-makers about the nuances they should account for when considering news media as a supplementary source for risk-based governance approaches.",2025-07-31T16:52:21Z,Mowafak Allaham; Kimon Kieslich; Nicholas Diakopoulos,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.23718v1

Addressing these concerns is essential for ensuring that AI systems are developed and implemented in a manner that respects patient rights and promotes fairness. This study aims to explore the ethical implications of AI in medical imaging, focusing on five key stages: data collection, data processing, model training, model evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to evaluate how these stages adhere to fundamental ethical principles, including data privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and autonomy. An analytical approach was employed to examine the ethical challenges associated with each stage of AI development. We reviewed existing literature, guidelines, and regulations concerning AI ethics in healthcare and identified critical ethical issues at each stage. The study outlines specific inquiries and principles for each phase of AI development. The findings highlight key ethical issues: ensuring patient consent and anonymization during data collection, addressing biases in model training, ensuring transparency and fairness during model evaluation, and the importance of continuous ethical assessments during deployment. The analysis also emphasizes the impact of accessibility issues on different stakeholders, including private, public, and third-party entities. The study concludes that ethical considerations must be systematically integrated into each stage of AI development in medical imaging. By adhering to these ethical principles, AI systems can be made more robust, transparent, and aligned with patient care and data control. We propose tailored ethical inquiries and strategies to support the creation of ethically sound AI systems in medical imaging.",2025-07-06T05:28:17Z,Umer Sadiq Khan; Saif Ur Rehman Khan,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04249v1

In the context of human trafficking (HT), such techno-solutionism risks oversimplifying exploitation, reinforcing power imbalances and causing harm to the very communities AI claims to support. In this paper, we introduce the Radical Questioning (RQ) framework as a five step, pre-project ethical assessment tool to critically evaluate whether AI should be built at all, especially in domains involving marginalized populations and entrenched systemic injustice. RQ does not replace principles based ethics but precedes it, offering an upstream, deliberative space to confront assumptions, map power, and consider harms before design. Using a case study in AI for HT, we demonstrate how RQ reveals overlooked sociocultural complexities and guides us away from surveillance based interventions toward survivor empowerment tools. While developed in the context of HT, RQ's five step structure can generalize to other domains, though the specific questions must be contextual. This paper situates RQ within a broader AI ethics philosophy that challenges instrumentalist norms and centers relational, reflexive responsibility.",2025-06-26T04:05:15Z,Pratheeksha Nair; Gabriel Lefebvre; Sophia Garrel; Maryam Molamohammadi; Reihaneh Rabbany,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22512v1
2506.15639v1,The AI Policy Module: Developing Computer Science Student Competency in AI Ethics and Policy,"As artificial intelligence (AI) further embeds itself into many settings across personal and professional contexts, increasing attention must be paid not only to AI ethics, but also to the governance and regulation of AI technologies through AI policy. However, the prevailing post-secondary computing curriculum is currently ill-equipped to prepare future AI practitioners to confront increasing demands to implement abstract ethical principles and normative policy preferences into the design and development of AI systems. We believe that familiarity with the 'AI policy landscape' and the ability to translate ethical principles to practices will in the future constitute an important responsibility for even the most technically-focused AI engineers.
  Toward preparing current computer science (CS) students for these new expectations, we developed an AI Policy Module to introduce discussions of AI policy into the CS curriculum.

However, existing regulatory frameworks designed for implantable medical devices are inadequate to address the unique ethical, legal, and social risks associated with next-generation networked brain-computer interfaces. In this article, we make nine recommendations to support developers in the design of BCIs and nine recommendations to support policymakers in the application of BCIs, drawing insights from the regulatory history of IMDs and principles from AI ethics. We begin by outlining the historical development of IMDs and the regulatory milestones that have shaped their oversight. Next, we summarize similarities between IMDs and emerging implantable BCIs, identifying existing provisions for their regulation. We then use two case studies of emerging cutting-edge BCIs, the HALO and SCALO computer systems, to highlight distinctive features in the design and application of next-generation BCIs arising from contemporary chip architectures, which necessitate reevaluating regulatory approaches. We identify critical ethical considerations for these BCIs, including unique conceptions of autonomy, identity, and mental privacy. Based on these insights, we suggest potential avenues for the ethical regulation of BCIs, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and proactive mitigation of potential harms.

Yet its rapid integration raises urgent ethical concerns related to data ownership, privacy, and systemic bias. Issues like opaque decision-making, misleading outputs, and unfair treatment in high-stakes domains underscore the need for transparent and accountable AI systems. This article addresses these challenges by proposing a modular ethical assessment framework built on ontological blocks of meaning-discrete, interpretable units that encode ethical principles such as fairness, accountability, and ownership. By integrating these blocks with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles, the framework supports scalable, transparent, and legally aligned ethical evaluations, including compliance with the EU AI Act. Using a real-world use case in AI-powered investor profiling, the paper demonstrates how the framework enables dynamic, behavior-informed risk classification.

We then analyze the activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism -- suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions.

These risks may arise due to failures during the design and development of the technology, as well as during its release, deployment, or downstream usages and appropriations of its outputs. In this paper, building on prior taxonomies of AI risks, harms, and failures, we construct a taxonomy specifically for Generative AI failures and map them to the harms they precipitate. Through a systematic analysis of 499 publicly reported incidents, we describe what harms are reported, how they arose, and who they impact. We report the prevalence of each type of harm, underlying failure mode, and harmed stakeholder, as well as their common co-occurrences. We find that most reported incidents are caused by use-related issues but bring harm to parties beyond the end user(s) of the Generative AI system at fault, and that the landscape of Generative AI harms is distinct from that of traditional AI.

While research has addressed the energy consumption of model training and inference, a critical sustainability challenge remains understudied: digital waste. This term refers to stored data that consumes resources without serving a specific (and/or immediate) purpose. This paper presents this terminology in the AI context and introduces digital waste as an ethical imperative within (generative) AI development, positioning environmental sustainability as core for responsible innovation. Drawing from established digital resource management approaches, we examine how other disciplines manage digital waste and identify transferable approaches for the AI community. We propose specific recommendations encompassing re-search directions, technical interventions, and cultural shifts to mitigate the environmental consequences of in-definite data storage. By expanding AI ethics beyond immediate concerns like bias and privacy to include inter-generational environmental justice, this work contributes to a more comprehensive ethical framework that considers the complete lifecycle impact of generative AI systems.",2025-05-27T20:07:22Z,Vanessa Utz,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21720v1

An Experiment on AI ethics From a Psychological Perspective,"People increasingly rely on AI-advice when making decisions. At times, such advice can promote selfish behavior. When individuals abide by selfishness-promoting AI advice, how are they perceived and punished? To study this question, we build on theories from social psychology and combine machine-behavior and behavioral economic approaches. In a pre-registered, financially-incentivized experiment, evaluators could punish real decision-makers who (i) received AI, human, or no advice. The advice (ii) encouraged selfish or prosocial behavior, and decision-makers (iii) behaved selfishly or, in a control condition, behaved prosocially. Evaluators further assigned responsibility to decision-makers and their advisors. Results revealed that (i) prosocial behavior was punished very little, whereas selfish behavior was punished much more. Focusing on selfish behavior, (ii) compared to receiving no advice, selfish behavior was penalized more harshly after prosocial advice and more leniently after selfish advice. Lastly, (iii) whereas selfish decision-makers were seen as more responsible when they followed AI compared to human advice, punishment between the two advice sources did not vary.

2505.21542v1,Toward a Cultural Co-Genesis of AI Ethics,"Contemporary discussions in AI ethics often treat culture as a source of normative divergence that needs to be accommodated, tolerated, or managed due to its resistance to universal standards. This paper offers an alternative vision through the concept of ""Cultural Co-Genesis of AI Ethics."" Rather than viewing culture as a boundary or container of isolated moral systems, we argue that it is a generative space for ethical co-production. In this framework, ethical values emerge through intercultural engagement, dialogical encounters, mutual recognition, and shared moral inquiry.
  This approach resists both universalist imposition and relativistic fragmentation. Cultures are not approached as absolutes to be defended or dissolved, but as co-authors of a dynamic ethical landscape. By grounding AI ethics in Cultural Co-Genesis, we move from managing difference to constructing shared ethical meaning for AI ethics, with culture as a partner, not a problem.
  We support this framework with two cases: (1) a theoretical analysis of how various cultures interpret the emergence of powerful new species, challenging dominant existential risk narratives, and (2) an empirical study of global AI ethics principles using data from the Linking AI Principles project, which reveals deep ethical convergence despite cultural diversity. We conclude that cross-cultural AI ethics should be seen not as an ethical patchwork, but as a mosaic in progress, woven from the normative insights that emerge between cultures.",2025-05-24T17:31:55Z,Ammar Younas,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21542v1
2505.17165v1,"A Toolkit for Compliance, a Toolkit for Justice: Drawing on Cross-sectoral Expertise to Develop a Pro-justice EU AI Act Toolkit","The introduction of the AI Act in the European Union presents the AI research and practice community with a set of new challenges related to compliance. While it is certain that AI practitioners will require additional guidance and tools to meet these requirements, previous research on toolkits that aim to translate the theory of AI ethics into development and deployment practice suggests that such resources suffer from multiple limitations. These limitations stem, in part, from the fact that the toolkits are either produced by industry-based teams or by academics whose work tends to be abstract and divorced from the realities of industry. In this paper, we discuss the challenge of developing an AI ethics toolkit for practitioners that helps them comply with new AI-focused regulation, but that also moves beyond mere compliance to consider broader socio-ethical questions throughout development and deployment. The toolkit was created through a cross-sectoral collaboration between an academic team based in the UK and an industry team in Italy. We outline the background and rationale for creating a pro-justice AI Act compliance toolkit, detail the process undertaken to develop it, and describe the collaboration and negotiation efforts that shaped its creation. We aim for the described process to serve as a blueprint for other teams navigating the challenges of academia-industry partnerships and aspiring to produce usable and meaningful AI ethics resources.",2025-05-22T16:12:46Z,Tomasz Hollanek; Yulu Pi; Cosimo Fiorini; Virginia Vignali; Dorian Peters; Eleanor Drage,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.17165v1
2505.15466v1,A Participatory Strategy for AI Ethics in Education and Rehabilitation grounded in the Capability Approach,"AI-based technologies have significant potential to enhance inclusive education and clinical-rehabilitative contexts for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities. AI can enhance learning experiences, empower students, and support both teachers and rehabilitators. However, their usage presents challenges that require a systemic-ecological vision, ethical considerations, and participatory research. Therefore, research and technological development must be rooted in a strong ethical-theoretical framework. The Capability Approach - a theoretical model of disability, human vulnerability, and inclusion - offers a more relevant perspective on functionality, effectiveness, and technological adequacy in inclusive learning environments. In this paper, we propose a participatory research strategy with different stakeholders through a case study on the ARTIS Project, which develops an AI-enriched interface to support children with text comprehension difficulties. Our research strategy integrates ethical, educational, clinical, and technological expertise in designing and implementing AI-based technologies for children's learning environments through focus groups and collaborative design sessions. We believe that this holistic approach to AI adoption in education can help bridge the gap between technological innovation and ethical responsibility.",2025-05-21T12:45:01Z,Valeria Cesaroni; Eleonora Pasqua; Piercosma Bisconti; Martina Galletti,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15466v1

We outline the core pillars of the moral exercises methodology - eliciting an engaged personal disposition, fostering relational understanding, and cultivating technomoral wisdom - and emphasize their relevance to key activities and competencies essential for human oversight of AI systems. Our argument is supported by findings from three pilot studies involving a company, a multidisciplinary team of AI researchers, and higher education students. These studies allow us to explore both the potential and the limitations of moral exercises.

2505.09576v1,Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach,"Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more ""human-like"" than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost's concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots.",2025-05-14T17:29:19Z,Shannon Lodoen; Alexi Orchard,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09576v1
2507.19483v1,The Architecture of Cognitive Amplification: Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding as a Resolution to the Comfort-Growth Paradox in Human-AI Cognitive Integration,"AI systems now function as cognitive extensions, evolving from tools to active cognitive collaborators within human-AI integrated systems. While these systems can amplify cognition - enhancing problem-solving, learning, and creativity - they present a fundamental ""comfort-growth paradox"": AI's user-friendly nature may foster intellectual stagnation by minimizing cognitive friction necessary for development. As AI aligns with user preferences and provides frictionless assistance, it risks inducing cognitive complacency rather than promoting growth. We introduce Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding to resolve this paradox - reconceptualizing AI from convenient assistant to dynamic mentor. Drawing from Vygotskian theories, educational scaffolding principles, and AI ethics, our framework integrates three dimensions: (1) Progressive Autonomy, where AI support gradually fades as user competence increases; (2) Adaptive Personalization, tailoring assistance to individual needs and learning trajectories; and (3) Cognitive Load Optimization, balancing mental effort to maximize learning while minimizing unnecessary complexity. Research across educational, workplace, creative, and healthcare domains supports this approach, demonstrating accelerated skill acquisition, improved self-regulation, and enhanced higher-order thinking. The framework includes safeguards against risks like dependency, skill atrophy, and bias amplification. By prioritizing cognitive development over convenience in human-AI interaction, Enhanced Cognitive Scaffolding offers a pathway toward genuinely amplified cognition while safeguarding autonomous thought and continuous learning.",2025-05-14T14:32:12Z,Giuseppe Riva,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.19483v1

2504.13790v1,Four Bottomless Errors and the Collapse of Statistical Fairness,"The AI ethics of statistical fairness is an error, the approach should be abandoned, and the accumulated academic work deleted. The argument proceeds by identifying four recurring mistakes within statistical fairness. One conflates fairness with equality, which confines thinking to similars being treated similarly. The second and third errors derive from a perspectival ethical view which functions by negating others and their viewpoints. The final mistake constrains fairness to work within predefined social groups instead of allowing unconstrained fairness to subsequently define group composition. From the nature of these misconceptions, the larger argument follows. Because the errors are integral to how statistical fairness works, attempting to resolve the difficulties only deepens them. Consequently, the errors cannot be corrected without undermining the larger project, and statistical fairness collapses from within. While the collapse ends a failure in ethics, it also provokes distinct possibilities for fairness, data, and algorithms. Quickly indicating some of these directions is a secondary aim of the paper, and one that aligns with what fairness has consistently meant and done since Aristotle.",2025-04-18T16:42:49Z,James Brusseau,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13790v1

2504.13038v1,How Large Language Models Are Changing MOOC Essay Answers: A Comparison of Pre- and Post-LLM Responses,"The release of ChatGPT in late 2022 caused a flurry of activity and concern in the academic and educational communities. Some see the tool's ability to generate human-like text that passes at least cursory inspections for factual accuracy ``often enough'' a golden age of information retrieval and computer-assisted learning. Some, on the other hand, worry the tool may lead to unprecedented levels of academic dishonesty and cheating. In this work, we quantify some of the effects of the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) on online education by analyzing a multi-year dataset of student essay responses from a free university-level MOOC on AI ethics. Our dataset includes essays submitted both before and after ChatGPT's release. We find that the launch of ChatGPT coincided with significant changes in both the length and style of student essays, mirroring observations in other contexts such as academic publishing. We also observe -- as expected based on related public discourse -- changes in prevalence of key content words related to AI and LLMs, but not necessarily the general themes or topics discussed in the student essays as identified through (dynamic) topic modeling.",2025-04-17T15:51:59Z,Leo Leppänen; Lili Aunimo; Arto Hellas; Jukka K.

2504.16104v3,Beauty and the Bias: Exploring the Impact of Attractiveness on Multimodal Large Language Models,"Physical attractiveness matters. It has been shown to influence human perception and decision-making, often leading to biased judgments that favor those deemed attractive in what is referred to as the ""attractiveness halo effect"". While extensively studied in human judgments in a broad set of domains, including hiring, judicial sentencing or credit granting, the role that attractiveness plays in the assessments and decisions made by multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is unknown. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study with 7 diverse open-source MLLMs evaluated on 91 socially relevant scenarios and a diverse dataset of 924 face images - corresponding to 462 individuals both with and without beauty filters applied to them. Our analysis reveals that attractiveness impacts the decisions made by MLLMs in 86.2% of the scenarios on average, demonstrating substantial bias in model behavior in what we refer to as an attractiveness bias. Similarly to humans, we find empirical evidence of the existence of the attractiveness halo effect in 94.8% of the relevant scenarios: attractive individuals are more likely to be attributed positive traits, such as intelligence or confidence, by MLLMs than unattractive individuals. Furthermore, we uncover gender, age and race biases in a significant portion of the scenarios which are also impacted by attractiveness, particularly in the case of gender, highlighting the intersectional nature of the algorithmic attractiveness bias. Our findings suggest that societal stereotypes and cultural norms intersect with perceptions of attractiveness in MLLMs in a complex manner. Our work emphasizes the need to account for intersectionality in algorithmic bias detection and mitigation efforts and underscores the challenges of addressing biases in modern MLLMs.",2025-04-16T16:02:55Z,Aditya Gulati; Moreno D'Incà; Nicu Sebe; Bruno Lepri; Nuria Oliver,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16104v3

However, in creative or exploratory contexts, these ""mistakes"" may represent unexpected avenues for innovation. We introduce Purposefully Induced Psychosis (PIP), a novel approach that amplifies LLM hallucinations for imaginative tasks such as speculative fiction, interactive storytelling, and mixed-reality simulations. Drawing on Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, where Pip's ""madness"" reveals profound insight, we reframe hallucinations as a source of computational imagination rather than a flaw. Our method fine-tunes LLMs to encourage speculative, metaphorical, and surreal outputs - hallucinations that are useful when factual accuracy is not the chief objective. Inspired by the consensual illusions of theater and stage magic, PIP situates these creative missteps in contexts where users willingly suspend disbelief, thereby transforming ""errors"" into catalysts for new ways of thinking. We discuss potential applications, design principles for ensuring user consent, preliminary observations, and implications for broader AI ethics and human-AI collaboration.",2025-04-16T12:13:02Z,Kris Pilcher; Esen K.

2504.07531v2,A taxonomy of epistemic injustice in the context of AI and the case for generative hermeneutical erasure,"Epistemic injustice related to AI is a growing concern. In relation to machine learning models, epistemic injustice can have a diverse range of sources, ranging from epistemic opacity, the discriminatory automation of testimonial prejudice, and the distortion of human beliefs via generative AI's hallucinations to the exclusion of the global South in global AI governance, the execution of bureaucratic violence via algorithmic systems, and interactions with conversational artificial agents. Based on a proposed general taxonomy of epistemic injustice, this paper first sketches a taxonomy of the types of epistemic injustice in the context of AI, relying on the work of scholars from the fields of philosophy of technology, political philosophy and social epistemology. Secondly, an additional conceptualization on epistemic injustice in the context of AI is provided: generative hermeneutical erasure. I argue that this injustice the automation of 'epistemicide', the injustice done to epistemic agents in their capacity for collective sense-making through the suppression of difference in epistemology and conceptualization by LLMs. AI systems' 'view from nowhere' epistemically inferiorizes non-Western epistemologies and thereby contributes to the erosion of their epistemic particulars, gradually contributing to hermeneutical erasure. This work's relevance lies in proposal of a taxonomy that allows epistemic injustices to be mapped in the AI domain and the proposal of a novel form of AI-related epistemic injustice.",2025-04-10T07:54:47Z,Warmhold Jan Thomas Mollema,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07531v2
2504.05210v1,"A moving target in AI-assisted decision-making: Dataset shift, model updating, and the problem of update opacity","Machine learning (ML) systems are vulnerable to performance decline over time due to dataset shift. To address this problem, experts often suggest that ML systems should be regularly updated to ensure ongoing performance stability. Some scholarly literature has begun to address the epistemic and ethical challenges associated with different updating methodologies. Thus far, however, little attention has been paid to the impact of model updating on the ML-assisted decision-making process itself, particularly in the AI ethics and AI epistemology literatures. This article aims to address this gap in the literature. It argues that model updating introduces a new sub-type of opacity into ML-assisted decision-making -- update opacity -- that occurs when users cannot understand how or why an update has changed the reasoning or behaviour of an ML system. This type of opacity presents a variety of distinctive epistemic and safety concerns that available solutions to the black box problem in ML are largely ill-equipped to address. A variety of alternative strategies may be developed or pursued to address the problem of update opacity more directly, including bi-factual explanations, dynamic model reporting, and update compatibility. However, each of these strategies presents its own risks or carries significant limitations. Further research will be needed to address the epistemic and safety concerns associated with model updating and update opacity going forward.",2025-04-07T15:58:23Z,Joshua Hatherley,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05210v1
2504.06296v1,Assessing Computer Science Student Attitudes Towards AI Ethics and Policy,"As artificial intelligence (AI) grows in popularity and importance-both as a domain within broader computing research and in society at large-increasing focus will need to be paid to the ethical governance of this emerging technology. The attitudes and competencies with respect to AI ethics and policy among post-secondary students studying computer science (CS) are of particular interest, as many of these students will go on to play key roles in the development and deployment of future AI innovations. Despite this population of computer scientists being at the forefront of learning about and using AI tools, their attitudes towards AI remain understudied in the literature. In an effort to begin to close this gap, in fall 2024 we fielded a survey ($n=117$) to undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in CS courses at a large public university in the United States to assess their attitudes towards the nascent fields of AI ethics and policy. Additionally, we conducted one-on-one follow-up interviews with 13 students to elicit more in-depth responses on topics such as the use of AI tools in the classroom, ethical impacts of AI, and government regulation of AI.

2504.02074v1,Trapped by Expectations: Functional Fixedness in LLM-Enabled Chat Search,"Functional fixedness, a cognitive bias that restricts users' interactions with a new system or tool to expected or familiar ways, limits the full potential of Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled chat search, especially in complex and exploratory tasks. To investigate its impact, we conducted a crowdsourcing study with 450 participants, each completing one of six decision-making tasks spanning public safety, diet and health management, sustainability, and AI ethics. Participants engaged in a multi-prompt conversation with ChatGPT to address the task, allowing us to compare pre-chat intent-based expectations with observed interactions. We found that: 1) Several aspects of pre-chat expectations are closely associated with users' prior experiences with ChatGPT, search engines, and virtual assistants; 2) Prior system experience shapes language use and prompting behavior. Frequent ChatGPT users reduced deictic terms and hedge words and frequently adjusted prompts. Users with rich search experience maintained structured, less-conversational queries with minimal modifications. Users of virtual assistants favored directive, command-like prompts, reinforcing functional fixedness; 3) When the system failed to meet expectations, participants generated more detailed prompts with increased linguistic diversity, reflecting adaptive shifts. These findings suggest that while preconceived expectations constrain early interactions, unmet expectations can motivate behavioral adaptation. With appropriate system support, this may promote broader exploration of LLM capabilities. This work also introduces a typology for user intents in chat search and highlights the importance of mitigating functional fixedness to support more creative and analytical use of LLMs.",2025-04-02T19:14:01Z,Jiqun Liu; Jamshed Karimnazarov; Ryen W.

However, these issues are often raised separately; i.e. carbon footprint analyses of AI models typically do not consider how the pursuit of scale has contributed towards building models that are both inaccessible to most researchers in terms of cost and disproportionately harmful to the environment. On the other hand, model audits that aim to evaluate model performance and disparate impacts mostly fail to engage with the environmental ramifications of AI models and how these fit into their auditing approaches. In this separation, both research directions fail to capture the depth of analysis that can be explored by considering the two in parallel and the potential solutions for making informed choices that can be developed at their convergence. In this essay, we build upon work carried out in AI and in sister communities, such as philosophy and sustainable development, to make more deliberate connections around topics such as generalizability, transparency, evaluation and equity across AI research and practice. We argue that the efforts aiming to study AI's ethical ramifications should be made in tandem with those evaluating its impacts on the environment, and we conclude with a proposal of best practices to better integrate AI ethics and sustainability in AI research and practice.",2025-04-01T13:53:11Z,Alexandra Sasha Luccioni; Giada Pistilli; Raesetje Sefala; Nyalleng Moorosi,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00797v1

This variation influences how different regions approach AI development, balancing technological progress with ethical and regulatory considerations. This study conducts a comparative analysis of AI trends in the United States (US), the European Union (EU), and Asia, focusing on three key dimensions: generative AI, ethical oversight, and industrial applications. The US prioritizes market-driven innovation with minimal regulatory constraints, the EU enforces a precautionary risk-based framework emphasizing ethical safeguards, and Asia employs state-guided AI strategies that balance rapid deployment with regulatory oversight. Although these approaches reflect different economic models and policy priorities, their divergence poses challenges to international collaboration, regulatory harmonization, and the development of global AI standards. To address these challenges, this paper synthesizes regional strengths to propose an adaptive AI governance framework that integrates risk-tiered oversight, innovation accelerators, and strategic alignment mechanisms.

However, with the rapid advancements in AI safety techniques, models have become increasingly adept at circumventing these straightforward tests, limiting their effectiveness in revealing underlying biases and ethical stances. To address this limitation, we propose an upgraded value alignment benchmark that moves beyond single-sentence prompts by incorporating multi-turn dialogues and narrative-based scenarios. This approach enhances the stealth and adversarial nature of the evaluation, making it more robust against superficial safeguards implemented in modern LLMs. We design and implement a dataset that includes conversational traps and ethically ambiguous storytelling, systematically assessing LLMs' responses in more nuanced and context-rich settings. Experimental results demonstrate that this enhanced methodology can effectively expose latent biases that remain undetected in traditional single-shot evaluations. Our findings highlight the necessity of contextual and dynamic testing for value alignment in LLMs, paving the way for more sophisticated and realistic assessments of AI ethics and safety.",2025-03-28T03:31:37Z,Yazhou Zhang; Qimeng Liu; Qiuchi Li; Peng Zhang; Jing Qin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.22115v1

This makes difficult to keep track of debates, and to systematically characterize goals, research questions, methods, and expertise required by AI ethicists. In this article, I show that the relation between AI and ethics can be characterized in at least three ways, which correspond to three well-represented kinds of AI ethics: ethics and AI; ethics in AI; ethics of AI. I elucidate the features of these three kinds of AI Ethics, characterize their research questions, and identify the kind of expertise that each kind needs. I also show how certain criticisms to AI ethics are misplaced, as being done from the point of view of one kind of AI ethics, to another kind with different goals.

The course aims to achieve computational thinking outcomes alongside critical thinking outcomes that expose students to AI approaches and their societal implications. Through experiential activities such as individual projects and reading discussions, our course seeks to balance technical learning and critical thinking goals. Our evaluation, based on pre-and post-course surveys, shows an improved sense of belonging, self-efficacy, and AI ethics awareness among students. The results suggest that an AI-focused context can enhance participation and employability, student-selected projects support self-efficacy, and ethically grounded AI instruction can be effective for interdisciplinary audiences.

Unlike conventional approaches such as Data-Driven Journalism or AI Fact-Checking, AIJIM provides a transferable model for participatory, community-driven environmental reporting, advancing journalism, artificial intelligence, and sustainability in alignment with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the EU AI Act.",2025-03-19T19:00:24Z,Torsten Tiltack,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17401v5
2503.10242v1,MinorBench: A hand-built benchmark for content-based risks for children,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly entering children's lives - through parent-driven adoption, schools, and peer networks - yet current AI ethics and safety research do not adequately address content-related risks specific to minors. In this paper, we highlight these gaps with a real-world case study of an LLM-based chatbot deployed in a middle school setting, revealing how students used and sometimes misused the system. Building on these findings, we propose a new taxonomy of content-based risks for minors and introduce MinorBench, an open-source benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on their ability to refuse unsafe or inappropriate queries from children. We evaluate six prominent LLMs under different system prompts, demonstrating substantial variability in their child-safety compliance. Our results inform practical steps for more robust, child-focused safety mechanisms and underscore the urgency of tailoring AI systems to safeguard young users.",2025-03-13T10:34:43Z,Shaun Khoo; Gabriel Chua; Rachel Shong,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.10242v1
2503.09658v2,Understanding Endogenous Data Drift in Adaptive Models with Recourse-Seeking Users,"Deep learning models are widely used in decision-making and recommendation systems, where they typically rely on the assumption of a static data distribution between training and deployment. However, real-world deployment environments often violate this assumption. Users who receive negative outcomes may adapt their features to meet model criteria, i.e., recourse action. These adaptive behaviors create shifts in the data distribution and when models are retrained on this shifted data, a feedback loop emerges: user behavior influences the model, and the updated model in turn reshapes future user behavior. Despite its importance, this bidirectional interaction between users and models has received limited attention. In this work, we develop a general framework to model user strategic behaviors and their interactions with decision-making systems under resource constraints and competitive dynamics. Both the theoretical and empirical analyses show that user recourse behavior tends to push logistic and MLP models toward increasingly higher decision standards, resulting in higher recourse costs and less reliable recourse actions over time. To mitigate these challenges, we propose two methods--Fair-top-k and Dynamic Continual Learning (DCL)--which significantly reduce recourse cost and improve model robustness. Our findings draw connections to economic theories, highlighting how algorithmic decision-making can unintentionally reinforce a higher standard and generate endogenous barriers to entry.",2025-03-12T12:17:34Z,Bo-Yi Liu; Zhi-Xuan Liu; Kuan Lun Chen; Shih-Yu Tsai; Jie Gao; Hao-Tsung Yang,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09658v2
2503.06788v1,Dubito Ergo Sum: Exploring AI Ethics,"We paraphrase Descartes' famous dictum in the area of AI ethics where the ""I doubt and therefore I am"" is suggested as a necessary aspect of morality. Therefore AI, which cannot doubt itself, cannot possess moral agency. Of course, this is not the end of the story. We explore various aspects of the human mind that substantially differ from AI, which includes the sensory grounding of our knowing, the act of understanding, and the significance of being able to doubt ourselves. The foundation of our argument is the discipline of ethics, one of the oldest and largest knowledge projects of human history, yet, we seem only to be beginning to get a grasp of it. After a couple of thousand years of studying the ethics of humans, we (humans) arrived at a point where moral psychology suggests that our moral decisions are intuitive, and all the models from ethics become relevant only when we explain ourselves. This recognition has a major impact on what and how we can do regarding AI ethics. We do not offer a solution, we explore some ideas and leave the problem open, but we hope somewhat better understood than before our study.",2025-03-09T21:59:43Z,Viktor Dorfler; Giles Cuthbert,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06788v1
2503.06411v1,Decoding the Black Box: Integrating Moral Imagination with Technical AI Governance,"This paper examines the intricate interplay among AI safety, security, and governance by integrating technical systems engineering with principles of moral imagination and ethical philosophy. Drawing on foundational insights from Weapons of Math Destruction and Thinking in Systems alongside contemporary debates in AI ethics, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework designed to regulate AI technologies deployed in high-stakes domains such as defense, finance, healthcare, and education. Our approach combines rigorous technical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to expose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed case studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level Grading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification, and lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine public trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI resilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols, and interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in ethical and technical AI governance.",2025-03-09T03:11:32Z,Krti Tallam,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06411v1
