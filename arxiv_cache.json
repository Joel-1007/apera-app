{"What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?": [{"text": "Human cognition is constrained by processing limitations, leading to cognitive overload and inefficiencies in knowledge synthesis and decision-making. Large Language Models (LLMs) present an opportunity for cognitive augmentation, but their current reactive nature limits their real-world applicability. This position paper explores the potential of context-aware cognitive augmentation, where LLMs dynamically adapt to users' cognitive states and task environments to provide appropriate support. Through a think-aloud study in an exhibition setting, we examine how individuals interact with multi-modal information and identify key cognitive challenges in structuring, retrieving, and applying knowledge. Our findings highlight the need for AI-driven cognitive support systems that integrate real-time contextual awareness, personalized reasoning assistance, and socially adaptive interactions. We propose a framework for AI augmentation that seamlessly transitions between real-time cognitive support and post-experience knowledge organization, contributing to the design of more effective human-centered AI systems.", "file": "Intelligent Interaction Strategies for Context-Aware Cognitive Augmentation (2025)", "score": 0.95, "rank": 1, "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.13684v1", "type": "online"}, {"text": "Wearable devices are transforming human capabilities by seamlessly augmenting cognitive functions.

Our vision is threefold: (1) to enable users to discover new knowledge on-the-go through contextual interactive quizzes, fostering critical thinking and mindfulness, (2) to proactively detect misinformation, empowering users to critically assess information in real time, and (3) to provide spoken language correction and prompting hints for second language learning and effective communication. As an initial step toward this vision, we present Factually - a proactive, wearable fact-checking system integrated into devices like smartwatches or rings. Factually discreetly alerts users to potential falsehoods via vibrotactile feedback, helping them assess information critically. We demonstrate its utility through three illustrative scenarios, highlighting its potential to extend cognitive abilities for real-time misinformation detection.

Unlike prior methods that perform a single, static retrieval before generation and condition the entire generation on fixed reference images, AR-RAG performs context-aware retrievals at each generation step, using prior-generated patches as queries to retrieve and incorporate the most relevant patch-level visual references, enabling the model to respond to evolving generation needs while avoiding limitations (e.g., over-copying, stylistic bias, etc.) prevalent in existing methods. To realize AR-RAG, we propose two parallel frameworks: (1) Distribution-Augmentation in Decoding (DAiD), a training-free plug-and-use decoding strategy that directly merges the distribution of model-predicted patches with the distribution of retrieved patches, and (2) Feature-Augmentation in Decoding (FAiD), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that progressively smooths the features of retrieved patches via multi-scale convolution operations and leverages them to augment the image generation process.

Complex Answer Retrieval (CAR) is the retrieval of answers to such questions. In their simplest form, these questions are constructed from a topic entity (e.g., `cheese') and a facet (e.g., `health effects'). While topic matching has been thoroughly explored, we observe that some facets use general language that is unlikely to appear verbatim in answers. We call these low-utility facets. In this work, we present an approach to CAR that identifies and addresses low-utility facets. We propose two estimators of facet utility. These include exploiting the hierarchical structure of CAR queries and using facet frequency information from training data. To improve the retrieval performance on low-utility headings, we also include entity similarity scores using knowledge graph embeddings. We apply our approaches to a leading neural ranking technique, and evaluate using the TREC CAR dataset. We find that our approach perform significantly better than the unmodified neural ranker and other leading CAR techniques.

In this model, dark matter quanta are sterile massless particles that are emitted from the central regions of the galaxy in the radial direction. As a result, at large distances $r$ from the center of the galaxy, the mass density of dark matter has the form $\u03c1\\sim r^{-2}$, in contrast to the homogeneous model $\u03c1=Const$. In the cosmological context, the homogeneous model with massless particles corresponds to the radiation epoch of the expansion of the universe, while the proposed inhomogeneous model turns out to be equivalent to $\u039b$CDM. In this paper, scenarios will be considered in which the radial emission of dark matter is brought into hydrostatic equilibrium with a uniform background. It is shown that solutions exist if the uniform background has an equation of state typical for dark energy. Thus, this model describes a phase transition from dark matter inside the galaxy to dark energy outside of it. The specific mechanism for such a transition could be Bose-Einstein condensation. In addition, the question of what happens if dark matter particles are not sterile, for example, are photons of the Standard Model, is considered.", "file": "Galactic model with a phase transition from dark matter to dark energy (2021)", "score": 0.95, "rank": 3, "url": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.00366v1", "type": "online"}, {"text": "In this paper, research on AI based modeling technique to optimize development of new alloys with necessitated improvements in properties and chemical mixture over existing alloys as per functional requirements of product is done.

While these systems have primarily focused on applications such as advertisement recommendations (e.g., Google), personalized suggestions (e.g., Netflix and Spotify), and retail selection (e.g., Amazon), there is potential for these systems to benefit from a more global, socio-economic, and culturally aware approach, particularly as companies seek to expand into diverse markets. This paper aims to investigate the potential of a recommender system that considers cultural identity and socio-economic factors. We review the most recent developments in recommender systems and explore the impact of cultural identity and socio-economic factors on consumer preferences. We then propose an ontology and approach for incorporating these factors into recommender systems. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we present a scenario in consumer subscription plan selection within the entertainment industry. We argue that existing recommender systems have limited ability to precisely understand user preferences due to a lack of awareness of socio-economic factors and cultural identity. They also fail to update recommendations in response to changing socio-economic conditions. We explore various machine learning models and develop a final artificial neural network model (ANN) that addresses this gap. We evaluate the effectiveness of socio-economic and culturally aware recommender systems across four dimensions: Precision, Accuracy, F1, and Recall.
